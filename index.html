            ASSASSIAN's CREED is an action-adventure stealth video game
            franchise created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond and Corey May,
            developed and published by Ubisoft using the game engine Anvil and
            its more advanced derivatives. It depicts a centuries-old struggle,
            now and then, between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free
            will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The series
            features historical fiction, science fiction and characters,
            intertwined with real-world historical events and figures. For the
            majority of time players would control an Assassin in the past
            history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin
            Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.

          <p class="text-justify mt-md-4 ml-md-2 mr-md-2 text-light">
            The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and
            follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight
            for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through
            control. The game primarily takes place during the Third Crusade in
            the Holy Land in 1191, with the plot revolving around the Secret
            Order of Assassins, based upon the Hashshashin sect. The player is,
            in reality, playing as a modern-day man named Desmond Miles, who,
            through the use of a machine named the "Animus", is allowed the
            viewing and controlling of the protagonist's genetic memories of his
            ancestors, in this case, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the
            Assassins. Through this plot device, details emerge of a struggle
            between two factions: the Templar Knights and the Assassins, over an
            artifact known as the "Apple of Eden", an ancient artifact used to
            control minds.

          <p class="text-justify mt-md-4 ml-md-2 mr-md-2 text-light">
            The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising
            its storytelling, visuals, art design, and originality, although the
            game was also criticized for the repetitive nature of its gameplay.
            Assassin's Creed won several awards at E3 in 2006, as well as
            several end-year awards after its release. The game spawned a
            sequel, Assassin's Creed II, which was released in November 2009.
            Since the release and success of Assassin's Creed II, subsequent
            games have been released, with various other Assassins and time
            periods.

            Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure game[6] set in an open world
            environment and played from a third-person perspective in which the
            player primarily assumes the role of Altaïr, as experienced by
            protagonist Desmond Miles. The primary goal of the game is to carry
            out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of
            the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the
            Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy
            Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities—Jerusalem, Acre, or
            Damascus—to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the
            agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player
            minimal knowledge about the target and requires them to perform
            additional reconnaissance missions before attempting the
            assassination. These missions include eavesdropping, interrogation,
            pickpocketing, and completing tasks for informers and fellow
            Assassins.

            The player is made aware of how noticeable Altaïr is to enemy guards
            as well as the current state of alert in the local area via the
            "Social Status Icon". To perform many of the assassinations and
            other tasks, the player must consider the use of actions
            distinguished by its type of profile. Low-profile actions allow
            Altaïr to blend into nearby crowds, pass by other citizens, or
            perform other non-threatening tasks that can be used to hide and
            reduce the alertness level; the player can also use Altaïr's
            retractable hidden blade to attempt low-profile assassinations.
            High-profile actions are more noticeable, and include running,
            scaling the sides of buildings to climb to higher vantage points,
            and attacking foes; performing these actions at certain times may
            raise the local area's awareness level.

            Assassin's Creed received "generally favorable" reviews from
            critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Several
            publications such as Eurogamer, while still awarding the game decent
            scores, pointed out a number of significant shortcomings. Eurogamer
            stated that the gameplay "never evolves and ultimately becomes a bit
            boring, and quite amazingly repetitive. In Andrew P.'s review for
            EGM (Kage), he wrote that the game features "a challenging parkour
            path of escape. Famitsu awarded the Xbox 360 version of Assassin's
            Creed , while the PS3 version received a 37 out of 40, positively
            citing the story, presentation, and acrobatics, while criticizing
            the one button combat, map layout, and camera problems. Game
            Informer awarded Assassin's Creed a 9.5 out of 10, praising the
            control scheme, replay value, and intriguing story, but expressing
            frustration over the "repetitive" information gathering missions. On
            The Hotlist on ESPNEWS, ESPN's Aaron Boulding called the game's
            concept of social stealth "fairly original" and added, "Visually,
            the developers nailed it. GameTrailers similarly praised the story
            (giving a 9.7 score to its story), and also cited repetitive
            gameplay and "moronic" AI as somewhat stifling its potential.
            "Assassins Creed is one of those games that breaks new ground yet
            fails in nailing some fundamentals," said Gametrailers.The game also
            received a 10 out of 10 from GamesRadar.According to GamePro,
            Assassin's Creed is one of the "finest gaming experiences ever
            created" if you are willing to be "patient" due to the lack of
            fast-paced action.

            Sales for Assassin's Creed "greatly outstripped" the expectations of
            the publisher. In the UK, Assassin's Creed debuted at number one,
            knocking Infinity Ward's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare from the
            top; the majority of the debut sales were on the Xbox 360, which
            claimed 67% of the game's total sales. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation
            3 releases of Assassin's Creed each received a "Platinum" sales
            award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers
            Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies per
            version in the United Kingdom.[56] On April 16, 2009, Ubisoft
            revealed that the game had sold 8 million copies.

            Jade Raymond, producer of Assassin's Creed said: "For Assassin's
            Creed we wanted the score to capture the gruesome atmosphere of
            medieval warfare but also be edgy and contemporary. The musical
            score was composed by Jesper Kyd in 2007. Six tracks were made
            available online to those who have purchased the game; a password
            was given to people to insert at the soundtrack section of the
            Ubisoft website.[30] Several tracks are also available to listen to
            on Kyd's MySpace and his official website. The released tracks as a
            whole have the archaic Latin chorus and dark orchestral music, while
            the track "Meditation Begins" features a kind of Saltarello with a
            very ominous, dark, ambient overtone with men whispering in Latin.
            The atmosphere in these tracks is what Jesper Kyd is known for and
            is effective in situ. The soundtrack is available from various
            online music stores.
